# MDD App (Monde de Dév), Full Stack Angular/Spring Boot project

This repository houses both the Angular Frontend and the Spring Boot API backend for the MDD app project.

## Context

This project is the project 6 of the Angular/Java Full Stack OpenClassrooms Course.

## Project Description

ORION aims to create the next social network dedicated to developers: MDD (Monde de Dév). The main objective of this social network is to assist developers in finding jobs by facilitating connections and encouraging collaboration among peers with common interests. MDD could become a talent pool for companies seeking specific profiles.

Before launching MDD to a wider audience, the company wants to test it with a minimal version deployed internally, also known as MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

## MVP Features

The MVP will allow users to subscribe to programming-related topics such as JavaScript, Java, Python, Web3, etc. Their news feed will display articles chronologically based on these subscriptions. Users will also be able to write articles and post comments.

## Architecture

The project is developed using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. This architecture provides a clear separation between the user interface (frontend) and the business logic (backend), ensuring maximum scalability and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

frontend/: Contains the source code of the frontend application developed in Angular.
backend/: Contains the source code of the backend API developed in Spring Boot.
resources/: Contains resources necessary for the project, such as SQL script and Postman collection.

### Installation and Execution Instructions

To run the frontend and backend projects locally, please follow the specific instructions for each part in their respective directories.
